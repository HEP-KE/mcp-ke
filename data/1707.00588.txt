We investigate the constraints on the sum of neutrino masses (Σ mν) using the most recent cos-
mological data, which combines the distance measurement from baryonic acoustic oscillation in the
extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey DR14 quasar sample with the power spectra of
temperature and polarization anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background from the Planck
2015 data release. We also use other low-redshift observations including the baryonic acoustic os-
cillation at relatively low redshifts, the supernovae of type Ia and the local measurement of Hubble
constant. In the standard cosmological constant Λ cold dark matter plus massive neutrino model,
we obtain the 95% conﬁdence level upper limit to be Σ mν < 0.129 eV for the degenerate mass
hierarchy, Σmν < 0.159 eV for the normal mass hierarchy, and Σ mν < 0.189 eV for the inverted
mass hierarchy. Based on Bayesian evidence, we ﬁnd that the degenerate hierarchy is positively
supported, and the current data combination can not distinguish normal and inverted hierarchies.
Assuming the degenerate mass hierarchy, we extend our study to non-standard cosmological mod-
els including the generic dark energy, the spatial curvature, and the extra relativistic degrees of
freedom, respectively, but ﬁnd these models not favored by the data.
I. INTRODUCTION
The phenomena of neutrino oscillation have provided
convincing evidence for the neutrino non-zero masses and
the mass splittings (see Ref. [1] for a review). However,
the current experimental results can not decisively tell if
the third neutrino is heavier than the other two or not.
There are thus two potential mass hierarchies for three
active neutrinos, namely, the normal hierarchy (NH), in
which the third neutrino is the heaviest, and the inverted
hierarchy (IH), in which the third neutrino is the light-
est. The sum of neutrino masses (Σ mν) is also remained
unknown, and diﬀerent neutrino hierarchies would have
diﬀerent total mass. Taking into account the experimen-
tal results of the square mass diﬀerences [1], the lower
bound on Σmν is estimated to be 0 .06eV for NH, while
to be 0.10eV for IH. The upper limit on Σ mν is much
loose based on the experimental particle physics. For in-
stance, the most sensitive neutrino mass measurement to
date, involving the kinematics of tritium beta decay, pro-
vides a 95% conﬁdence level (CL) upper bound of 2.05eV
on the electron anti-neutrino mass [2].
Cosmology plays a signiﬁcant role in exploring the
neutrino masses (see Ref. [3] for a review), since they
can place stringent upper limits on Σ mν, which is a key
to resolving the neutrino masses by combining with the
square mass diﬀerences measured. Massive neutrinos are
initially relativistic in the Universe, and become non-
relativistic after a transition when their rest masses begin
to dominate. Imprints have been left on the cosmic mi-

crowave background (CMB) and the large scale structure
(LSS). The CMB is aﬀected through the early-time inte-
grated Sachs-Wolfe eﬀect [4], which shifts the amplitude
and location of the CMB acoustic peaks due to a change
of the redshift of matter-radiation equality. The LSS
is modiﬁed through suppressing the clustering of mat-
ter, due to the large free-streaming velocity of neutrinos.
Therefore, the massive neutrinos can be weighed using
the measurements of CMB and LSS [5–8].
Assuming the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model and
three active neutrinos are in degenerate hierarchy (DH) ,
namely with equal mass, the Planck Collaboration re-
cently reported the 95% CL upper limit on Σ mν to
be 0.49eV using the CMB temperature and polarization
anisotropies from the Planck 2015 data [5]. Adding the
gravitational lensing of the CMB from Planck 2015 data
relaxes the upper limit to be 0.59eV, a less stringent one.
Given the accuracy of the Planck 2015 data, assuming
the neutrinos in NH and IH would have negligible impact
on the constraints on the sum of neutrino masses.
Combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and
other low redshift data such as local Hubble constant
H0 and Type Ia supernovae can further tighten the con-
straints [9–18]. There are also eﬀorts on the constraints
by combining experimental data from particle physics
[19–21]. Especially, since the BAO data can signiﬁcantly
break the acoustic scale degeneracy, the sum of neutrino
masses is tightly constrained to 0.15eV by Ref. [22] after
adding the BAO data from LSS surveys [23–25]. This
result is close to the lower bound of neutrino masses in
the IH, namely 0.10eV. Current tightest constraints on
the neutrino total mass [26, 27] from cosmological data,
especially from Planck high-l polarization data of CMB,
already reached∼ 0.10eV given certain combinations of
data set, implying a favor of NH for neutrino. Never-
theless, it is necessary to take the mass prior set by the

neutrino mass hierarchy into account to get consistent
constraints. After taking the square mass diﬀerences into
account, we [22, 28] found that the upper limit of neu-
trino total mass becomes 0.18eV for NH, and 0.20eV for
IH. It was also shown by Ref. [28–36] that an extension
of the standard cosmology model, e.g., dynamical dark
energy and non-zero spatial curvature, would have sub-
tle impacts on constraining the sum of neutrino masses.
In this work we investigate the mass prior eﬀect on con-
straining the neutrino total mass in the standard cosmo-
logical model.
Most recently, the SDSS-IV extended Baryon Oscilla-
tion Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) [37] measured a BAO
scale in redshift space in the redshift interval 1 < z <2
for the ﬁrst time, using the clustering of 147,000 quasars
with redshift 0.8<z < 2.2. A spherically averaged BAO
distance toz = 1.52 is obtained, namely,DV (z = 1.52) =
3843± 147(rd/rd,ﬁd) [Mpc], which is of 3 .8% precision.
In this paper, this data point is denoted by eBOSS DR14
for simplicity. The SDSS-IV eBOSS measurement of the
BAO scale is expected to break the degeneracy between
the NH and IH scenarios of three active neutrinos at 2 σ
conﬁdence level [38].
In this work, we constrain the sum of neutrino masses
in the ΛCDM model by adding the recently released
eBOSS DR14 data. Besides the maximal likelihood anal-
ysis, we also employ the Bayesian statistics to infer the
parameters, and especially to perform model selections.
We expect to show that the current observations can im-
prove the previous constraints on Σmν signiﬁcantly, and
the neutrino mass hierarchies have to be considered to
analyze the current observational data. Due to possi-
ble degeneracy between the sum of neutrino masses and
a few extended cosmological parameters, similar studies
are proceeded under the framework of extended cosmo-
logical models by introducing the generic dark energy
(w), the non-zero spatial curvature (Ω k), and the extra
relativistic degree of freedom (Neﬀ), respectively.
The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. Sec. II
introduces the adopted cosmological models, the cosmo-
logical observations, and the method of statistical anal-
ysis. Sec. III shows the result of the constraints on Σ mν
in the ΛCDM model, while Sec. IV shows the eﬀect of a
few extended cosmological parameters on the constraints
on Σmν. In Sec. V, the conclusions are summarized.
II. MODELS, DA T ASET & METHODOLOGY
A. Cosmological models
In the ΛCDM plus massive neutrino model (hereafter,
νΛCDM for short), we put constraints on the sum of
neutrino masses with and without taking into account
the neutrino mass hierarchies. Speciﬁcally, we consider
the DH, NH, and IH of the neutrinos. Based on the neu-
trino oscillation phenomenon, the square mass diﬀerences
between three active neutrinos have been measured to be
∆m2
21 = 7.5× 10−5eV2 and|∆m2
31| = 2.5× 10−3eV2 [1].
Therefore, there is a lower bound, i.e. Σ mν ≥ 0.06eV,
for the NH, and Σmν≥ 0.10eV for the IH. There is not
such a lower bound for the DH, but Σmν should deserve
a positive value.
In the νΛCDM model, there are six base parameters
denoted by{ωb,ωc, 100θMC,τ,n s, ln(1010As)} plus a sev-
enth independent parameter denoted by Σmν for the sum
of neutrino masses. Here ωb and ωc are, respectively,
physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter to-
day.θMC is the ratio between sound horizon and angular
diameter distance at the decoupling epoch. τ is Thom-
son scatter optical depth due to reionization. ns and
As are, respectively, spectral index and amplitude of the
power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations.
The pivot scale is set to be kp = 0.05Mpc−1.
When the generic dark energy is taken into account,
an eighth independent parameter is introduced, which
describes the equation of state (EoS) of the dark energy.
This parameter is denoted by w, and the corresponding
cosmological model is theνwCDM model. When the spa-
tial curvature is considered, the eighth independent pa-
rameter is denoted by Ω k, and the corresponding model
is the νΩkΛCDM model. When the extra relativistic de-
gree of freedom is considered, the eighth independent pa-
rameter is denoted byNeﬀ, and the corresponding model
is the νNeﬀΛCDM model. For the above three extended
models, we only consider the upper limits on Σmν in the
DH scenario of three massive neutrinos, because the neu-
trino mass hierarchy would have negligible eﬀects on the
constraints given the current cosmological observations.
B. Cosmological data
The cosmological observations adopted by this work
include CMB, BAO, and other low-redshift surveys. To
be speciﬁc, the CMB data are composed of tempera-
ture anisotropies, polarizations, and gravitational lens-
ing of the CMB reported by the Planck 2015 data re-
lease [5]. The CMB lensing is used here since it is
very sensitive to the neutrino masses [39]. Speciﬁcally,
we utilize the angular power spectra of TT, TE, EE,
lowTEB, and gravitational lensing of the CMB. The
BAO data points come from the 6dF galaxy survey
[23], SDSS DR7 main galaxy sample [24], SDSS-III BOSS
DR12 LOWZ and CMASS galaxy samples [25], and the
SDSS-IV eBOSS DR14 quasar sample [37]. The super-
novae dataset is the “joint light-curve analysis” (JLA)
compilation of the supernovae of type Ia (SNe Ia) [40].
The local measurement of Hubble constant ( H0) comes
from the Hubble Space Telescope [41]. The full data
combination combines together all the cosmological ob-
servational data mentioned above. In fact, one can fur-
ther add other astrophysical data, such as the galaxy
weak lensing [42, 43], the redshift space distortion [44],
and the Planck cluster counts [45], to improve the con-
straints on the neutrino masses. Though these datasets

--- Page 3 ---

are directly related to the neutrino masses, however, the
amplitudes of power spectra of the cosmological pertur-
bations obtained from these observations are in tension
with the one obtained from the Planck CMB data. It is
believed that these observations deserve underlying un-
controlled systematics, which may bias the global ﬁtting.
Hence, we do not take them into account in this paper.
C. Statistical method
Given the observational dataset and the corresponding
likelihood functions, we utilize the Markov-Chain Monte-
Carlo (MCMC) sampler in the CosmoMC [46] to estimate
across the parameter space, and the PolyChord [47, 48]
plug-in of the CosmoMC to calculate the Bayesian evi-
dence for model selection.
The Bayesian evidence ( E) is deﬁned as an integral
of posterior probability distribution function (PDF), i.e.
P (θ), over the parameter space {θ}, i.e. E =
∫
dθP (θ)
[49]. Given two diﬀerent models M1 and M2, the loga-
rithmic Bayesian factor is evaluated as ∆ lnE = lnEM1−
lnEM2. When 0 < ∆ lnE < 1, the given dataset in-
dicates no signiﬁcant support for either model. When
1 < ∆ lnE < 3, there is a positive support for M1.
When 3 < ∆ lnE < 5, there is a strong support for
M1. When ∆ ln E > 5, there is a very strong support
for M1. Conversely, the negative values mean that the
dataset supports M2, rather than M1.
In this work,M2 usually denotesνDHΛCDM whileM1
denotes one of other models. An exception is that M1
denotes the NH while M2 denotes the IH, when we com-
pare the NH and the IH inνΛCDM. The parameter space
{θ} is consist of the six base parameters plus the sum of
neutrino masses for νΛCDM, while an eighth parameter
is further added when an extended model is considered.
For each model, the independent parameters have been
showed explicitly in section II A.
We also evaluate the best-ﬁt χ2. For any scenario, a
smaller value of the best-ﬁt χ2 implies that this scenario
ﬁts the dataset better. For both Bayesian and maximal
likelihood methods, the prior ranges for all the indepen-
dent parameters are set to be suﬃciently wide to avoid
aﬀecting the results of data analysis.
III. RESUL TS FOR THE νΛCDM MODEL
For the νΛCDM model, we present the results of pa-
rameter inference and model comparison in Tab. I and
in Fig. 1. To be speciﬁc, we show the 68% CL con-
straints on the six base parameters of the ΛCDM, and
the 95% CL upper limits on the sum of neutrino masses
in Tab. I. For three mass hierarchies of massive neutrinos,
we ﬁnd that the constraints on the six base parameters
of the ΛCDM are compatible within 68% CL. We also
list in Tab. I the best-ﬁt values ofχ2 and the logarithmic
Bayesian evidences. In Fig. 1, we depict the posterior
PDFs of the sum of neutrino masses. The red, green,
and blue solid curves, respectively, denote the posterior
PDFs of Σmν for DH, NH, and IH of massive neutrinos.
In addition, we wonder if the diﬀerence in neutrino mass
constraints are due to the diﬀerent priors in the parame-
ter Σmν. Therefore, we also depict in Fig. 1 the neutrino
mass constraints for theνDHΛCDM model with two non-
vanishing lower bounds, i.e., 0 .06eV (red dashed curve)
and 0.10eV (red dot-dashed curve).

For three neutrinos with degenerate mass, the upper
limit on the sum of neutrino masses is obtained to be
Σmν < 0.129 eV (95% CL) . (1)
This upper limit is close to the lower bound of 0 .10eV
required by the IH scenario. In fact, the upper limit
even becomes Σmν < 0.10 eV if the gravitational lensing
of the CMB is discarded in the global ﬁtting. As ex-
pected, the upper limit Σ mν < 0.129 eV is 3.7% tighter
than the existing one, e.g. Σ mν < 0.134 eV in Wang
et al. [28], which did not include the eBOSS DR14 data,
and Σmν < 0.197 eV in Zhang [31], which used a dif-
ferent BAO dataset. However, this constraint is slightly
looser than that of Σmν < 0.12eV obtained by combining
BOSS Lyman-α with Planck CMB [15].
The above results reveal the necessity of taking into
account the square mass diﬀerences between three mas-
sive neutrinos when one constrains the neutrino masses
with current cosmological observations. For three neu-
trinos with NH, the upper limit on the sum of neutrino
masses is given by
Σmν < 0.159 eV (95% CL) , (2)
while for IH, the result is given by
Σmν < 0.189 eV (95% CL) . (3)
Here we further consider the Bayesian model selection.
The logarithmic Bayesian factor between the neutrino
NH and IH scenarios is compatible with zero within one
standard deviation, while the diﬀerence of the best-ﬁt χ2
is given by χ2
NH,min−χ2
IH,min =−0.448. The adopted
dataset is ﬁtted nearly equally well by both NH and IH,
but it can not distinguish the two scenarios. Therefore,
more experiments of higher precision in the future are
needed to decisively distinguish the neutrino mass hier-
archies [32, 50]. In addition, comparing the Bayesian ev-
idences of the two scenarios with that of νDHΛCDM, we
ﬁnd that the νDHΛCDM is positively supported by the
adopted data combination. Based on the best-ﬁt χ2, we
ﬁnd that theνDHΛCDM ﬁts the data combination better,
since χ2
min in this scenario is smaller by around 2 than
those in the others. In addition, the constraints in (2)
and (3) are well consistent with those in Ref. [28], which
did not include the eBOSS DR14 data. Another exist-
ing work [29] has showed that the 95% CL upper bound
is Σmν < 0.118eV for the NH, and Σ mν < 0.135eV for
the IH. These constraints appear to be tighter than those
obtained by this work. However, the neutrino mass hi-
erarchy was parameterized in a diﬀerent way from this
work, and the data combination discarded the CMB lens-
ing and the eBOSS DR14 BAO but included the redshift
space distortion data.
From Fig. 1, we can conﬁrm that the diﬀerence in neu-
trino mass constraints are mainly due to the diﬀerent pri-
ors in the parameter Σmν. Given the current data com-
bination, the posterior PDF of Σ mν in the νNHΛCDM
(νIHΛCDM) is approximately overlapped with that in
the νDHΛCDM with a lower bound of 0 .06eV (0.10eV)
on Σmν. In the νDHΛCDM model, the 95% CL con-
straint on Σ mν is 0.164eV for a lower bound 0 .06eV,
while it is 0 .186eV for a lower bound 0 .10eV. These
constraints are consistent with those in (2) and (3), re-
spectively. Therefore, the priors in Σ mν have signiﬁ-
cant inﬂuence on the constraints on Σmν, given the cur-
rent data. However, νNHΛCDM and νIHΛCDM can ﬁt
the data slightly better than νDHΛCDM with non-zero
priors in Σ mν, since the best-ﬁt χ2 in the former two
scenarios are smaller by 3 − 4 than those in the latter
two. Comparing νNHΛCDM with νDHΛCDM+0.06eV
prior, we ﬁnd a negative support for the former sce-
nario due to ∆ lnE =−1.29. Comparing νIHΛCDM with
νDHΛCDM+0.10eV prior, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant support
for either scenario due to ∆ ln E =−0.11.
IV. RESUL TS FOR THE EXTENDED
COSMOLOGICAL MODELS
Based on the precision of current cosmological observa-
tions, the neutrino mass hierarchies have negligible eﬀects
on the constraints on Σ mν in the extended cosmologi-
cal models explored here. We thus explore the parame-
ter space by assuming the degenerate mass hierarchy in
the following. For the extended cosmological models, we
present the results of our data analysis in Tab. II and in
Fig. 2. Speciﬁcally, we show the 95% CL upper limits on
the sum of neutrino masses, and the 68% CL constraints
on the remaining seven parameters in Tab. II. For each
extended model, we depict the 1σ and 2σ CL contours in
the two-dimensional plane spanned by the sum of neu-
trino masses and the extended parameter in Fig. 2.

FIG. 2: Assuming the degenerate mass hierarchy, the 1σ and 2σ CL contours in the two-dimensional plane spanned by the sum
of neutrino masses and the extended cosmological parameters in νwCDM, νΩkΛCDM, and νNeﬀΛCDM, respectively. From
bottom to up, the horizontal dashed lines denote Σ mν = 0.06 eV, 0.10 eV, respectively.
For the νwCDM model, we obtain the upper limit on
the sum of neutrino masses to be Σ mν < 0.214 eV at
95% CL. This upper limit on Σ mν is indeed improved
compared with the existing ones, e.g. Σ mν < 0.268 eV
[28], Σmν < 0.304 eV [31], and Σ mν < 0.25 eV [34].
The constraint on w is w = −1.06+0.05
−0.04 at 68% CL,
deviating from w = −1 with a signiﬁcance of 1.2 σ.
From the left panel of Fig. 2, Σ mν is found to be
anti-correlated with w. Compared with the νDHΛCDM
model, we ﬁnd that the logarithmic Bayesian factor is
lnEνwCDM− lnEDH =−2.31, and the diﬀerence of the
best-ﬁt χ2 is χ2
νwCDM,min−χ2
DH,min =−6.744. There is
thus a negative support for the νwCDM model, but this
extended model ﬁts the adopted dataset better than the
νDHΛCDM model.
For the νΩkΛCDM model, we obtain the upper limit
on the sum of neutrino masses to be Σ mν < 0.294 eV at
95% CL, and the constraint on Ω k is Ωk = 0.0043+0.0024
−0.0028
at 68% CL. The signiﬁcance of a non-zero value of Ω k is
found to be around 1 .5 standard deviations. From the
middle panel of Fig. 2, Σ mν is found to be positively
correlated with Ωk. Therefore, adding the parameter Ω k
worsens the constraints on the neutrino masses. This
constraint on Σmν is compatible with the existing one in
Ref. [51], which studied two diﬀerent scenarios of neu-
trino mass hierarchy. Compared with the νDHΛCDM
model, we ﬁnd that the logarithmic Bayesian factor is
lnEνΩkΛCDM−lnEDH =−1.97, and the diﬀerence of the
best-ﬁtχ2 is given byχ2
νΩkΛCDM,min−χ2
DH,min =−1.324.
There is thus a negative support for the νΩkΛCDM
model, even though this extended model ﬁts the adopted
dataset slightly better than the νDHΛCDM model.
For theνNeﬀΛCDM model, we obtain the upper limit
on the sum of neutrino masses to be Σ mν < 0.17 eV at
95% CL, and the constraint on Neﬀ isNeﬀ = 3.265+0.159
−0.157
at 68% CL. SinceNeﬀ = 3.046 in standard ΛCDM model,
the signiﬁcance of extra relativistic degree is 1.4σ . From
the right panel of Fig. 2, Σ mν is found to be positively
correlated with Neﬀ. This constraint on Σ mν is looser
than the existing one Σ mν < 0.14eV in Ref. [14], which
used the high-ℓ CMB data and the Lyman-α data. Com-
pared with the νDHΛCDM model, we ﬁnd that the log-
arithmic Bayesian factor is ln EνNeffΛCDM− lnEDH =
−3.00, and the diﬀerence of the best-ﬁt χ2 is given by
χ2
νNeffΛCDM,min−χ2
DH,min = −0.216. Therefore, there
is a negative support for the νNeﬀΛCDM model, even
though this extended model ﬁts the adopted dataset as
nearly well as the νDHΛCDM.
V. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
In this paper, we updated the cosmological constraints
on the sum of neutrino masses Σ mν using the most up-
to-date observational data. Two more realistic mass hi-
erarchies of massive neutrinos, namely, the normal mass
hierarchy and the inverted mass hierarchy, are employed
in addition to the degenerate mass hierarchy. In the
νΛCDM, for the DH, we obtained an improved upper
limit Σmν < 0.129eV at 95% CL. Taking into account
the squared mass diﬀerences between three massive neu-
trinos, we obtained the 95% CL upper bound to be
Σmν < 0.159eV for the NH, while to be Σ mν < 0.189eV
for the IH. Based on the Bayesian evidence, the adopted
dataset can not distinguish the two mass orderings. In
addition, we found that the priors in Σ mν can signiﬁ-
cantly impact the cosmological constraints on Σmν, given
the adopted data combination. Future cosmological ob-
servations of higher precision are needed to get more deci-
sive conclusions. For example, BAO [38, 52], CMB [53–
56], and galaxy shear surveys [57, 58] might reach the
sensitivity to measure the neutrino masses and to deter-
mine the mass hierarchy in the future.
Since the extended cosmology model can have degen-
eracy with the neutrino mass, we extended our studies
to include the generic dark energy, the spatial curva-
ture, and the extra relativistic degrees of freedom, re-
spectively, by assuming the degenerate mass hierarchy.
Compared with theνDHΛCDM model, we found negative
supports for these extended cosmological models based

on Bayesian model selection, due to the introduction of
an additional independent parameter in each model.
We compared the results of this work with the exist-
ing ones. Comparing with our existing works [22, 28],
which used the same data sets except the eBOSS DR14,
we found that the eBOSS DR14 brings about at most a
few percent corrections to the neutrino mass constraints.
However, it is challenging to compare this work with oth-
ers, since they usually used diﬀerent combinations of cos-
mological data or even diﬀerent models. For example,
adding the CMB lensing to the data combination can
worsen the constraints on the neutrino masses [5]. When
the CMB lensing was discarded for the νDHΛCDM, the
95% CL upper limit on Σ mν even became 0 .10eV, as
found by this work. It is much tighter than that in (1),
and has reached the minimal mass expected in the IH
scenario. For a second example, adding a prior on the
reionization optical depth to the data combination could
tighten the constraints on the neutrino masses, see for
example Refs. [16, 27, 32, 59]. In addition, the degener-
acy between the hot dark matter model and the massive
neutrinos has been considered in Ref. [30], while the im-
pacts of dynamical dark energy model on weighing mas-
sive neutrinos have been studied in Refs. [28, 31, 34, 36].
We have speciﬁed comparisons between the results of this
work with several existing ones in last two sections.
